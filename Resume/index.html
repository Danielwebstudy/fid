 <h2>More about me</h2>
 <p class="margins">I'm currently a college student enrolled in the digital media track,
 pursuing a career in 3D modeling. Specifically, what piqued my interest in 3D modeling is the ability to create small pieces that
 reflect a bigger world, or in some cases, even creating an entire world. Other interests of mine include biking, swimming, gaming,
 photography, and drawing. My hobbies keep me engaged and inspired, and even help to develop skills such as clear communication,
 understanding that progress takes time, and an eye for detail. Some more personal details about me include my polite attitude,
 willingness to help, and dedication, all of which serve a great deal when working with others. Finally, some recent favorite TV
 shows that my family and I have been watching are: Severance, Foundation, and Silo; if you have any recommendations, feel free to
 comment about them, as I love to find new interesting shows.</p>
