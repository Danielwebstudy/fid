    <dt>Meet Beacon, he is a bright parrot that loves to chirp. He likes his outdoor time, but is extremely friendly and will fly to those who call out to him.</dt>

    <dt>Meet Pim, he is a young fellow who loves to sleep. His mom was very energetic, so we expect that of him, too. He is still very impressive and, for now, only likes those whom he chooses.</dt>

    <dt>Meet Gadget, he is a nifty little cat who will claw his way into any crevice. He is very loving, but loves his alone time in little spots.</dt>
