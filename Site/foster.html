<h2>Fostering</h2>
<p>Not sure about a forever home, consider fostering! We here at Alafaya Rescue can always use some help with the rescues, and can't always provide full one-on-one time with the rescues. If you're interested, please <a href="contact.html">contact</a> us.</p>

    <dt>Why Foster?</dt>
    <dd>To provide the best care for these beloved fosters, we look to the community. By fostering, you would be helping not just the fostered animal but the organization as a whole. While you would be expected to pay for food and shelter, medical visits would be covered by us. Additionally, by fostering, you're helping develop the personality and health of the foster of your choice.</dd>
    <dt>What are the requirements?</dt>
    <dd>Here at Alafaya Rescue, we want our fosters to have a good life, so we look to those who have a good living space, and that would be able to have someone with the foster for a large majority of the day. Furthermore, we find that those with more people in the house often have a better influence on the personalities of the fosters.</dd>
    <dt>How long Is The Foster period?</dt>
    <dd>Typically, rescues are only fostered for around 2 months, which greatly improves the transition of the fostered animal to the new family. While rare, we have seen fosters stay for a year. However, it should be noted that at any point, one can choose to stop fostering whenever they so choose.</dd>
