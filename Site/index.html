<h2>About</h2>
<p>We are a dedicated bunch aiming to both clean up the community and care for its many inhabitants. We have been around since 2020 and have fallen in love with the area. Our goal is plain and simple: rescue as many animals as we can and find them a long-term home where they will be loved. We rescue dogs, cats, birds, and tortoises. Although we more commonly rescue dogs and cats than anything else. Going beyond just rescuing, we aim to serve our community through the mutual love of animals. We hold and join events that aim to heal hearts and bring joy. Please explore our many pages to learn more about us.</p>
